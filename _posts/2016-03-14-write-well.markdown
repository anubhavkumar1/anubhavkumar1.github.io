Your voice is in the fiber of your communications. It’s what makes people feel like they’re listening to someone they know when they visit your website. It should come from a real place.
People often use the words voice and tone interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing. Your voice is your company’s public personality. It doesn’t change much from day to day. Like your own individual personality, it comes through in all of your content and influences how people perceive you. On the other hand, your tone changes to fit the situation. While your voice is more about you, your tone is about your readers and how they feel. Together, your voice and tone make up your writing style. We’ll get into tone in the next chapter, but let’s start with finding your voice.
In this chapter, we’ll discuss how to:
• Find your voice and translate it to the page
• Pick a few useful brand attributes
• Choose the right words to talk about your company
We’ll also show you some exercises to help you through this process and get your teammates and contributors on board.
